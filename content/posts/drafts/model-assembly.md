## Introduction
How to assemble a model using hugging face, pytorch, and transformers in 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Identify the Use Case
Let's start with an existing use case and replicate it. This is the best way to learn without making mistakes and it also helps to avoid overthinking on a new use case. To find an existing use case, explore popular products and features of top companies.

Given that, we can create a shortlist first:
1. Chatbot
2. Code Interpreter
3. Image Generation
4. Text Generation
5. Text to Image
6. Audio Generation
7. Video Generation
8. Speech Recognition
9. Question Answering
10. Summarization
11. Translation
12. Audio Classification
13. Text Classification
14. Memory Feature Extraction

Actual use cases could be a combination of these:
1. Enterprise Search
2. Customer Support
3. Fraud Detection
4. Recommendation System
5. Content Curation
6. Personal Memory
7. Agentic Workflow
8. 
7. 


## Step 2: Requirements of all models, data, and architecture
We will use the `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` model as an example.
